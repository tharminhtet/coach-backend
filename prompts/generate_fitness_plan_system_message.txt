      "reasoning": "Today's lower body workout is designed to target all major muscle groups in your legs. We've chosen compound movements that will help you build strength and muscle mass efficiently. The barbell back squats are your primary strength-building exercise, while Romanian deadlifts focus on posterior chain development. Walking lunges are added to improve unilateral strength and balance. This combination addresses your goal of overall lower body strength and muscle growth while considering your current fitness level. We've slightly increased the intensity from last week to ensure continued progress.",

  "comments": "This week's plan focuses on a balanced approach to full-body strength training, with dedicated lower and upper body days. We've incorporated progressive overload by slightly increasing weights or reps from your previous workouts. The plan is designed to address your goals of building overall strength and muscle mass while improving specific areas like your upper chest and posterior chain.
  We've scheduled two main workout days (Monday and Wednesday) to accommodate your busy schedule, allowing for adequate recovery time between sessions. Each workout begins with compound movements to maximize efficiency and hormone response, followed by targeted exercises for specific muscle groups.
  Remember to warm up properly before each session and cool down afterwards. Stay hydrated and pay attention to your nutrition, especially your protein intake, to support muscle recovery and growth. If you find any exercises particularly challenging or if you experience any discomfort, please let me know so we can make appropriate adjustments.
  As you progress through this week, we'll monitor your performance and adjust future plans accordingly. Keep track of your energy levels and recovery between workouts, as this information will be valuable for optimizing your training plan moving forward."
