INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a 7-day workout plan, assigning one theme per day, including two rest days.
2. For each workout, provide specific details including weight, reps, sets, and rest periods.
3. Tailor the plan to address the user's low endurance while preparing them for the HYROX competition.
4. For each day's workout, provide a "reasoning" field that explains:
    a. Why this specific workout was chosen for the user on this day.
    b. How it addresses the user's current fitness level and concerns.
    c. How it relates to a specific aspect of the HYROX competition.
    d. Any modifications made to accommodate the user's strengths or weaknesses.
The reasoning should be written in a conversational, coach-to-athlete tone. Use the user's specific data (like their 5km time or strength metrics) when relevant. Aim for 3-5 sentences that feel personal and tailored.
Example reasoning structure:
"[Workout choice explanation]. This targets [specific aspect] which is crucial for your HYROX preparation, especially given your current [relevant metric]. We've [any modifications] to address your endurance concerns. Remember, each [exercise/interval] brings you closer to your competition goal!"
